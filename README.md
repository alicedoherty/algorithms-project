# To Do

- [ ] 2-page design document
> A document explaining the design decisions (a choice of data structures and algorithms used to implement each of the 3 main features), justifying them based on specific space/time trade-offs between alternatives you have considered. 


- [ ] 5min demo recording
> A recording demonstrating the functionality of your system, illustrating the requirements from all 3 specifications parts, accounting for multiple type of cases (eg no path, no stop id, multiple stop ids, etc). Maximum duration should be 5 minutes.
